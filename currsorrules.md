# Cosmic Clicker: Cursor Rules

1. **Phase Completion:**
   - Each phase or major feature must be fully tested and meet the criteria in `clicker_phases.md` before starting the next phase.

2. **Version Control:**
   - All changes must be committed and pushed to GitHub after each phase or major feature is completed and tested.

3. **Documentation:**
   - `clicker_phases.md` and `roadmap.md` must be referenced and updated as features are completed, tested, or changed.

4. **Design Principles:**
   - All code and UI must follow the clicker game design principles outlined in `clicker_phases.md` (clarity, feedback, progression, reward loops, accessibility, minimal friction, and thorough testing).

5. **Testing:**
   - Both automated (E2E, unit) and manual testing must be performed for all new features and phases. No feature is considered complete until it passes all relevant tests.

6. **Continuous Improvement:**
   - Regularly review and refine the plan, roadmap, and design principles to ensure the game remains fun, accessible, and polished.
