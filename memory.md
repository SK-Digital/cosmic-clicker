## Key Notes
- Main gameplay is in `src/components/Game.tsx` and `GalaxyClicker.tsx`.
- Upgrades and rush events are managed in `GameContext.tsx`.
- Visual/UI issues (e.g., weird box) may be caused by containers in `Game.tsx`, `GalaxyClicker.tsx`, or background overlays.
- Rush events and event chance upgrades are planned for future milestones.
- All major changes should be committed to the [SK-Digital/cosmic-clicker](https://github.com/SK-Digital/cosmic-clicker) repo.

Update this file whenever the file structure or major project details change. 

- Updated `Background.tsx` to improve the falling star animation with smoother transitions.
- Adjusted z-index and layout in `Game.tsx` to resolve the weird box issue by ensuring proper layering of elements.
- Fixed meteor (falling star) animation in `Background.tsx` to use the correct animation class and improved the visual style for a more realistic shooting star effect.
- Updated `StardustCounter.tsx` to make the resource panel less boxy and better blended with the background.

# Playwright
- Playwright is installed as a dependency (@playwright/test), but no Playwright config or test files are present in the project yet.

# Animation Logic
- Star and meteor (falling star) animations are implemented in src/components/Background.tsx, with data generated by src/utils/gameUtils.ts.
- Animation keyframes and utility classes are defined in src/index.css.

# Next Steps
- Refine the falling star (meteor) animation in Background.tsx and related CSS.
- Add Playwright config and a basic UI test for visual review.

# Recent Changes
- Refined the falling star (meteor) animation in src/components/Background.tsx to use a glowing head and fading tail, with a more natural diagonal path.
- Added a new CSS class and keyframes (animate-meteor-refined, meteor-refined) in src/index.css for the improved shooting star effect.
- Updated StardustCounter panel in src/components/StardustCounter.tsx to be less boxy, more glassy, and better blended with the background.
- Falling star (meteor) animation now only uses a glowing orb for each meteor—no trail or line, just a soft, glowing head.
- Backdrop-blur has been removed from the StardustCounter panel for a cleaner look.
- StardustCounter panel is now fully transparent and non-boxy, blending seamlessly with the background.
- Falling stars (meteors) are now simple, small, twinkling white dots (2-4px), with no glow, trail, or orb effect.
